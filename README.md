This is a fork of the [Urho3D game engine](https://github.com/urho3d/Urho3D) which is being used for the development of my upcoming video game project. It was forked when [Urho3D](https://github.com/urho3d/Urho3D) is `322 commits` ahead of its `1.6` release, and since then the fork has been received patches, modifications, cuts and updates introduced by both the [Urho3D](https://github.com/urho3d/Urho3D) developers and myself. 

A list of modifications, cuts, and updates since the fork was born: 
* Rest in pieces `Android`, `iOS`, `OS X`, `tvOS`, `Xcode` and `Web` targets. This fork puts heavy emphasises on `Windows` and `Linux` targets. 
* Modifications to the both the game engine and the `AngelScript`-based editor to use a different folder naming and structure. 
* Reworked `Urho3DPlayer`. 
* Integration with [Herbal](https://github.com/Florastamine/Herbal), a Lua- and GUI-based build target configuration tool. 

The fork follows the same license as [Urho3D](https://github.com/urho3d/Urho3D).
